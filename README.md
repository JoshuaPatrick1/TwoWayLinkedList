# TwoWayLinkedList
This project implements a doubly linked list in Java as part of Exercise 24.3. Unlike a one‑way linked list, the TwoWayLinkedList class supports traversal in both directions by maintaining next and previous references in each node. The class implements the MyList interface and provides all standard list operations such as insertion, removal, retrieval, and size tracking.
